                <strong> Exploring consensus via python.(24 Mar 2018)</strong>
                </br>
                </br>
                <strong>Intro</strong>
                </br>
                How do you get different computers that are part of a larger cluster to agree on what the value of
                something is?
                </br>
                Suppose a client sent a request to server 1 to set the value of a key
                <i>foo</i> to the value
                <i>bar.</i> However, server 1 is part of a cluster of N servers(there are good reasons for having
                servers be
                part of a cluster, but we wont got into that)
                </br>
                </br>
                <img src="../imgs/client-request.png" alt="client request">
                </br>
                </br>
                Thus the request; set foo=bar needs to be propagated to all the servers. A naive approach would go
                something like;</br>
                When server 1 gets the request, it also sends that request to sever 2 which in turn sends the request to
                server 3 ...</br>
                However, a couple of problems arise with that approach;</br>
                - What happens if there is some network error anywhere in that chain of requests?</br>
                - Does the client have to wait for all those round-trips of requests to finish before it can get a
                response?</br>
                - What if a 3 letter named goverment agency intercepts the request and changes it from
                <i>foo=bar</i> to
                <i>foo=baz</i>?
                </br>
                - And so forth</br>
                </br>
                How we get computers to agree on the value of some data, is through consensus.</br>
                There are a number of consensus protocols with varying degrees of usage in the real world. Here is a
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_algorithm">wikipedia
                    rabbit hole</a> to get you started.</br>
                For the remainder of this post, we will explore one of those algorithms; CASPaxos.
                </br>
                </br>

                <strong>CASPaxos</strong>
                </br>
                CASPaxos is a consensus algorithm by Denis Rystsov, the
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07000.pdf">white paper</a> is
                available from arxiv.
                </br>
                The paper is surprisingly simple and also easy to comprehend.</br>
                In a nutshell, the algorithm goes like this;</br>
                </br>
                <strong>A. Prepare phase:</strong>
                <img src="../imgs/caspaxos-prepare.png" alt="CASPaxos prepare">
                </br>
                1. client sends request to server 1. Server 1 generates a ballot number and sends that ballot to all
                other servers</br>
                2. The other servers will return a conflict(to server 1) if they already saw a greater ballot number.
                Persists the ballot
                number and returns a confirmation either with an empty value (if they haven't accepted any value yet) or
                with a tuple of an accepted value and its ballot number.</br>
                3. Server 1 waits for a majority of servers to respond with confirmation.</br>
                </br>

                <strong>B. Accept phase:</strong>
                <img src="../imgs/caspaxos-accept.png" alt="CASPaxos accept">
                </br>
                4. Server 1 sends the earlier generated ballot number and value(ie foo=bar) to all other servers.</br>
                5. The servers will return a conflict if they already saw a greater ballot number. They mark the
                received ballot number and
                value as the accepted value and returns a confirmation.</br>
                </br>

                <strong>C. End:</strong>
                </br>
                <img src="../imgs/caspaxos-end.png" alt="CASPaxos end">
                </br>
                6. Server 1 waits for a majority of servers to respond with confirmation.</br>
                7. Returns a response to the client.</br>
                </br>
                <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The description above is not 100% correct. I have left out a number of
                important details(eg
                in the paper, the client doesn't send a request like, set foo=bar, instead it sends a change function).
                You
                should read the actual paper for full details. However, the description above will suffice for now.

                </br>
                </br>
                <strong>python</strong>
                </br>
                Lets explore how the algorithm achieves consensus, we will use python to try and demonstrate this.</br>
                We are going to build a proto-type of a distributed storage system, and we will use CASPaxos to achieve
                consensus among the
                various servers in our storage system.</br>
                First of all, the code for the proposer(server1 in our CASPaxos description above.)</br>

            And the code for the Acceptors(the other servers in our CASPaxos description above).

            We are going to use python class instances to represent(in place of) actual servers. </br>
            We are going to create five servers named a1 .... a5 of type Acceptor.</br>
            We will also create another one server of type Proposer. </br>
            We will have a client send a request to the proposer, then CASPaxos algorithm will take over. </br>
            At the end of it all, the client's request will have been persisted in all the 5 servers.</br>
            <pre><code class="python">

            <strong>Conclusion</strong>
            </br>
            CASPaxos can help you achieve consensus in your distributed systems and make failure handling a bit easier.
            </br>
            The protocol also has sections that cover other system administration aspects of distributed systems such as
            Adding and removing
            servers among others.</br>
            I invite you to go read the
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07000.pdf">paper. </a>
            </br>
            It's author, Denis Rystsov, is on twitter
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/rystsov">@rystsov</a> and I'm grateful to him
            for answering my queries whenever I called on him.
            </br>
            </br>
            CASPaxos, however, won't help you when 3 letter named agencies decide to tamper with your requests.</br>
