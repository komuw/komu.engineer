                <strong>How to use any programming language on AWS lambda.(01 October 2018)</strong>
                </br>
                </br>

                <strong>Intro</strong>
                </br>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS lambda</a> is a service that
                lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.</br>
                At the time of writing this blogpost, AWS lambda natively supports <strong>only</strong> the following
                programming
                languages/runtimes; <i>Node.js, Java, Python, .NET
                    Core</i> and <i>Go</i></br>
                Sometimes you may have a usecase for AWS lambda(serverless) but the programming language that you are
                using is not natively supported by AWS lambda.</br>

                If that is the case, worry not; you can still use your favorite programming language with AWS lambda
                even if AWS lambda does not natively support that language. </br>
                In this article, we explore how to do exactly that.

                </br></br>
                <strong>What up now</strong>
                </br>
                Let's say that our favorite programming language is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nim-lang.org">Nim</a>
                and we want to run our program written with Nim on AWS lambda.</br>
                The way to do that(at least the one we will explore in this blog) is by creating a <a target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)">shim</a> using a programming
                language that is already supported on AWS lambda.</br>
                The shim will accept lambda requests, it will then pass those requests to our Nim program and finally
                it will accept/listen for responses from our Nim program and marshal them into a
                form that AWS lambda can understand.</br></br>

                We will use python to create the shim(but you can use any of the other AWS lambda supported languages.)</br>
                The workflow is;
                <ol>
                    <li>The python program/shim gets a request from AWS lambda.</li>
                    <li>it serializes that request into json.</li>
                    <li>it writes that json into stdin</li>
                    <li>The Nim program reads from stdin</li>
                    <li>it unmarshals what it has read from stdin and acts on it.</li>
                    <li>it creates a json marshaled response</li>
                    <li>it writes that json response to stdout</li>
                    <li>The python program/shim reads that response from stdout</li>
                    <li>it unmarshals what it read(the response)</li>
                    <li>it sends the response back to AWS lambda.</li>
                </ol>

                So the python program and the Nim program communicate using JSON over stdin/stdout. </br>
                <strong>NB:</strong> You do not have to use json over stdin/stdout if you do not want; you could use
                rpc, unix
                sockets etc.</br></br>
                We have talked about python talking to the Nim program, but how will python talk to the Nim program if
                we
                can't run Nim on AWS lambda?</br>
                The answer lies with the fact that AWS supports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/running-executables-in-aws-lambda">running
                    arbitrary executables</a></br>
                So, as long as you are using a programming language that can compile binaries(that are either
                statically
                linked or built for the matching version of Amazon Linux) then you are good to go.

                </br></br>
                <strong>The Shim</strong>
                </br>
                Let's create our shim python program, <i>lambda.py</i>;
                <pre><code class="python">
# lambda.py
import os
import sys
import json
import shutil
import traceback
import subprocess

os.environ["PATH"] = (
    os.environ["PATH"] + ":" + os.environ.get("LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT", "LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT")
)

def handle(event, context):
    try:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(
            ["./main"],
            stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            universal_newlines=True
        )

        # write to binary program
        write_data = json.dumps({"event": event}) + "\n"
        proc.stdin.write(write_data)
        proc.stdin.flush()

        # read from binary program
        line = proc.stdout.readline()

        event = json.loads(line)

        proc.stdin.close()
        proc.stdout.close()

        proc.terminate()
        proc.wait(timeout=1.2)
    except Exception as e:
        exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()
        traceback.print_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback, limit=2, file=sys.stdout)
        return {"error": repr(e)}
    return event
                </code></pre>

                The <i>os.environ["PATH"]</i> part is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/running-executables-in-aws-lambda">necessary</a>
                for you to be able to
                reference(via relative path) any binaries that you upload.</br>
                So, the python shim; </br>
                <ul>
                    <li>receives request from AWS lambda(lambda calls the <i>handle</i> function for every invocation)</li>
                    <li>runs the binary Nim program(<i>./main</i>) via python's subprocess lib, converts the lamda
                        request to json and it then writes that request to the Nim program's stdin </li>
                    <li>it reads from the Nim program's stdout using readline and converts what it has read(the
                        response) from json</li>
                    <li>it returns that response to AWS lambda</li>
                </ul>
                The part where you need to be careful in writing the shim is:
                <ul>
                    <li>you need to make sure that you terminate whatever you are writing with a newline, <i>+"\n"</i></li>
                    <li>you should actually flush what you have written, <i>proc.stdin.flush()</i></li>
                    <li>you should use readline() to read from Nim program's stdout as opposed to read()</li>
                </ul>
                These precautions are necessary to avoid deadlocks <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/interacting-with-a-long-running-child-process-in-python">[1]</a>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html">[2]</a>

                </br></br>
                <strong>The Nim program</strong>
                </br>
                Our actual Nim program won't do much;
                <ul>
                    <li>it will just read from stdin</li>
                    <li>create a response that has the event it got from the shim echoed back, the current time and a
                        message containing Nim's version</li>
                    <li>it will convert that response to json and write it to stdout.</li>
                </ul>
                NB: the previous caveats about eliminating deadlocks also apply to the Nim program(or whichever
                programming language you are using.)</br>
                The nim program, <i>main.nim</i>;
                <pre><code class="nim">
# main.nim
import json
import times
import system

# read from stdin
var request: string = readLine(stdin)
let jsonReq = parseJson(request)

# for this example, we only use event; in real life you may also want to use context as well.
let event = jsonReq["event"]

var response =  %*
    {
    "EchoEvent": event,
    "Message": "hello fom Nim version: " & system.NimVersion,
    "CurrentTime":  format(times.now(), "d MMMM yyyy HH:mm")

    }

# write to stdout
echo response
                </code></pre>
                You can execute the Nim program locally on your machine:
                <pre><code class="bash">
echo '{"event": "myLambdaEventName", "context": "myLambdaContext"}' | nim compile --run main.nim

Hint: operation successful (34568 lines compiled; 0.703 sec total; 59.941MiB peakmem; Debug Build) [SuccessX]

{"EchoEvent":"myLambdaEventName","Message":"hello fom Nim version: 0.19.0","CurrentTime":"1 October 2018 13:55"}
                </code></pre>

                </br></br>
                <strong>Tie it up together</strong>
                </br>
                We have created the python shim and the Nim program, to tie it all together we need to:
                <ul>
                    <li>compile the Nim program into an executable(statically linked, ideally)</li>
                    <li>create a zip file containing the Nim executable and the python program</li>
                    <li>upload that zip file to AWS lambda</li>
                </ul>

                To create the Nim executable, run;
                <pre><code class="bash">
nim c -d:release main.nim
                </code></pre>
                This creates an executable in the current directory, the executable is called <i>main</i></br>
                The command, <i>nim c -d:release main.nim</i> should be ran from a Linux 64bit computer(since that is
                the architecture of the AWS lamda
                machines.) </br>
                If your programming language supports cross compilation, you can cross-compile to linux 64bit(without
                having to change machines). Nim <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/nimc.html#cross-compilation">supports
                    cross compilation</a> but - this was my first Nim program ever - I was not able to
                cross-compile
                so I had to compile using a 64bit machine running ubuntu.</br></br>

                Next we create a zipfile
                <pre><code class="bash">
zip mylambda.zip main lambda.py
                </code></pre>
                This creates a zip file called <i>mylambda.zip</i> in the current directory.

                </br></br>
                <strong>Run in AWS lambda</strong>
                </br>
                Finally, let's open up the AWS lambda console and:</br></br>
                1. create an AWS lambda function where we chose Python 3.6 as the runtime:</br></br>
                <img src="./imgs/create-func.png" alt="create lambda function" style="max-height:220px;">
                </br></br>
                2. upload our zip file:</br></br>
                <img src="./imgs/upload-func.png" alt="upload lambda zip file" style="max-height:220px;"></br>
                make sure the runtime is Python 3.6 and Handler is <i>lambda.handle</i> ie our python file is called <i>lambda.py</i>
                and the function inside it is <i>def handle(event, context)</i></br></br>

                3. click save and you'll be taken to a page that shows the unzipped file contents:
                </br></br>
                <img src="./imgs/saved-func.png" alt="unzipped lambda contents" style="max-height:220px;"></br></br>

                4. create a AWS lamda test:</br></br>
                <img src="./imgs/create-lambda-test.png" alt="create lambda test" style="max-height:220px;"></br></br>

                5. execute/run that lambda test:</br></br>
                <img src="./imgs/execute-lambda-test.png" alt="execute lambda test" style="max-height:220px;"></br></br></br>

                As you can see, the lambda function was executed/invoked and it ran calling our Nim binary which
                returned results accordingly.

                </br>
                </br>
                <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                </br>
                We have been able to use our language of choice(Nim) on AWS lambda even though lambda doesn't support
                Nim as a programming language.</br>
                Shims are a powerful way of connecting two seemingly incompatible systems.</br>
                If you are interested in running your programs on AWS lambda without having to write your own shim, TJ
                Holowaychuk has you covered with his <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/apex/up">up
                    project</a> which I had written about in an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.komu.engineer/blogs/python-lambda">earlier
                    blog post </a></br>
                This all begs the question; instead of AWS rolling out access to lambda one language at a time, why
                cant they create a common interface/shim that all languages can target?</br></br>

                <strong>Update(06 March 2021);</strong></br>
                On 29th November 2018(~60 days after I wrote this blogpost), AWS announced <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-use-any-programming-language-and-share-common-components">Lambda support for any programming language.</a></br>
                And no, I don't think this blogpost had anything to do with it.
