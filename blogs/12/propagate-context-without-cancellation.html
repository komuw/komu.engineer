            <strong>How to propagate context without cancellation. (23 Aug 2023)</strong>
            </br></br>
            <strong>note:</strong> This blogpost was initially written on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://tyk.io/blog/how-to-propagate-context-without-cancellation">Tyk's blog</a>. It's reprinted
            here for posterity, but the Tyk post is still the canonical reference.</br></br>

            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tyk.io/cloud">Tyk Cloud</a> is a fully managed service that
            makes it easy for developers to create, secure, publish and maintain APIs at any scale, anywhere in the
            world.</br></br>

            Whenever customers sign up for the service, we send them an email welcoming them onboard. We emit logs to
            enable our developers to troubleshoot if any error occurs in the email-sending functionality (network
            timeouts, etc.).</br></br>

            To improve the developer debugging experience, we added corresponding request-scoped values like request-ids
            to those logs. The way you typically do that in Go is by using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context">context.Context</a>. Maintaining a consistent
            understanding of the context is essential as data flows through various stages. This helps to ensure
            accurate processing, error handling, logging, and other operational aspects.</br></br>

            While this information usually has a timeframe for the service to respond (after which it is cancelled), we
            often need to send this flow of data and context between different components or stages of a system before
            it is interrupted or prematurely terminated.</br></br>

            This blog looks deeper at propagating context without cancellation, why it's important, and how we found a
            solution.</br></br>

            <strong id="into the context">Into the context we go</strong></br></br>
            Initially, our code looked like this:
            <pre><code class="go">
func OnboardAccount(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Create a subsription, etc
    // Send email to the customer.
    go sendEmail("accountID", "subscriptionPlan")
}

func sendEmail(accountID, subscriptionPlanName string) {
    ctx := context.Background()
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 120*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    // Call a third-party email sending service.
    err := thirdPartyMailService(ctx, accountID, subscriptionPlan)
    if err != nil {
        log.Error("Failed to send email.", err)
    } 
}
            </code></pre>
            The <i>OnboardAccount</i> http handler is called when someone signs up as a customer on <a target="_blank"
                rel="noopener" href="https://tyk.io/cloud">Tyk Cloud</a>. It does several things - synchronously - like
            creating a subscription, creating an organisation, etc. and eventually sends a welcome email to the customer
            asynchronously.</br></br>

            As mentioned, we wanted to update the code so that <i>sendEmail</i> will take in a <a target="_blank"
                rel="noopener" href="https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context">context.Context</a> as a parameter.
            We would then pass in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.Context">http.Request.Context</a> when calling
            <i>sendEmail</i>; this way, we could have richer logs emitted in the <i>sendEmail</i> function since they
            would now
            contain request-scoped values(request-ids, etc.) for each specific request.</br></br>

            We updated the code to:
            <pre><code class="go">
func OnboardAccount(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Create a subscription, etc
    // Send email to the customer.
    go sendEmail(r.Context(), "accountID", "subscriptionPlan")
}

func sendEmail(ctx context.Context, accountID, subscriptionPlan string) {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 120*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    // Call a third-party email sending service.
    err := thirdPartyMailService(ctx, accountID, subscriptionPlan)
    if err != nil {
        log.Error("Failed to send email.", err)
    } 
}
            </code></pre>
            Soon after, we started seeing these errors in our services' logs:</br>
            <i>"RequestID=Kj24jR8LQha, Failed to send email. context canceled"</i></br>
            It was great to see that logs now contained the relevant request-scoped values like RequestID, but what's up
            with that context cancelled error?</br></br>

            This happened for almost every call of <i>sendEmail</i>, which was surprising since we were using a
            substantial context duration when calling <i>thirdPartyMailService</i>. This value has served us very well
            in the past. We established that the third-party email SaaS systems were healthy and experienced no
            downtime.</br></br>

            After a cup of coffee and proper scrutiny of the new code, we zeroed in on this line:</br>
            <pre><code class="go">
go sendEmail(r.Context(), "accountID", "subscriptionPlan")
            </code></pre>
            The problem was that the context, <i>r.Context()</i>, is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.20.3/src/net/http/request.go#L337-L340">scoped to the
                lifetime</a> of the http request. Thus,
            this
            context would get cancelled as soon as the <i>OnboardAccount</i> http handler returns. Since the
            <i>sendEmail</i>
            call is
            running in a goroutine, it is possible that it would run after <i>OnboardAccount</i> has returned (and by
            extension, the context would already be cancelled.)</br></br>

            Here is a small stand-alone reproducer of the issue:
            <pre><code class="go">
func main() {
    OnboardAccount()
}

func OnboardAccount() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    defer cancel()
    go sendEmail(ctx)
    fmt.Println("OnboardAccount called")
}

func sendEmail(ctx context.Context) {
    fmt.Println("sendEmail called")
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 120*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    fmt.Println("sendEmail, ctx.Err(): ", ctx.Err())
}
            </code></pre>
            <pre><code class="bash"> 
go run -race ./...
            </code></pre>
            <pre><code class="bash"> 
OnboardAccount called
sendEmail called
sendEmail, ctx.Err():  context canceled
        </code></pre>
            We reverted the code change and began looking for permanent solutions to the problem. <strong>We need to
                propagate a
                context's values without also propagating its cancellation.</strong></br></br>

            <strong id="solution space">Solution space</strong></br></br>
            Surely, someone else in the Go community must have experienced similar issues? It turns out, this was not an
            uncommon problem; there was even an existing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40221">Go proposal</a> suggesting to fix the issue in the
            standard
            library. At the time, that proposal had not yet been accepted, so we had to look for alternative solutions
            to the problem.</br></br>

            There are multiple [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/v0.8.0/internal/xcontext/xcontext.go">1</a>] [<a
                target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/pkgsite/internal/xcontext#Detach">2</a>] [<a target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
                href="https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+func%5C+Detach%28Context%29%3F%5C%28.%2Bcontext.Context%5C%29+-file:vendor+-file:pkg/mod&patternType=regexp&sm=1">3</a>]
            third-party packages that implement <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context">context.Context</a>, which you can
            propagate without cancellation. Most of those were <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.4#internalpackages">Go internal packages </a>, which we could not
            import.</br></br>

            We thus created a small library in our application that offered this functionality and updated our code to
            utilise it:
            <pre><code class="go"> 
import "our/pkg/xcontext"

func OnboardAccount(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Send email to the customer.
    go sendEmail(
        // Propagate context without cancellation.
        xcontext.Detach(r.Context()),
        "accountID",
        "subscriptionPlan",
    )
}
            </code></pre>
            This fixed the issue.</br></br>

            And, there's more good news; the aforementioned Go proposal has since been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40221#issuecomment-1487641790">accepted and implemented</a>,
            and it
            is available in Go v1.21 that was released in early August 2023. With the release, this is how you can use
            the newly added API:
            <pre><code class="go"> 
import "context"

func OnboardAccount(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Send email to the customer.
    go sendEmail(
        // Propagate context without cancellation.
        context.WithoutCancel(r.Context()),
        ...
    )
}
            </code></pre>
            Now, a question remains - what if someone forgets to use <i>xcontext.Detach</i> or
            <i>context.WithoutCancel?</i></br></br>

            Wouldn't it be better to have a linter for this scenario? I enquired on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://gophers.slack.com/">gophers-slack </a> whether anyone knew of
            one; nothing seemed available.</br></br>

            Soon after, Damian Gryski added this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
