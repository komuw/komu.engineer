            <a href="blogs/log-without-losing-context/log-without-losing-context.html">Logging without losing money or
                context.</a>(26 May 2020)
            </br>
            In order to minimize logging costs, conventional wisdom asks that you filter logs by severity and/or
            implement sampling.</br>
            This article articulates why that may be a bad idea, it then proposes an alternative that loses you neither
            money nor context and then finally it
            presents a proto-type implementation of that alternative.

                traces.</a>(18 November 2019)
            </br>
            This article assumes that you have come to the conclusion that you need stacktraces in your errors.</br>
            We are going to build a package that can annotate any errors - including the ones created by the stdlib
            <i>errors</i> package - with stack traces.

                clone.</a>(15 July 2019)
            </br>
            How do Celery, Resque, Sidekiq, among other background task processors
            work?</br>
            In this blogpost, we figure that out while building our own background task processor one step at a time.

            <a href="blogs/timeScaleDB/timescaleDB-for-logs.html">Storing application logs in an SQL database.</a>(23
            November 2018)
            </br>
            It's almost unheard of, these days, to store application logs in a structured datastore.</br>
            In this blogpost I propose and implement a logging pipeline that involves storing logs in
            PostgreSQL(timescaleDB)

            October
            2018)
            </br>
            Sometimes you may have a usecase for AWS lambda but the programming language that you are
            using is not natively supported by AWS lambda.</br>
            But you can still use your favorite programming language with AWS lambda even if it is not natively
            supported. </br>
            In this article, we explore how to do that.

            <a href="blogs/go-modules-early-peek.html">An early peek at Go modules.</a>(20 July 2018)
            </br>
            In this article, we add versioning to a go package while working outside of GOPATH.</br>
            We take a peek into the future of developing in Go, we stumble and we rise.

                change.</a>(02
            June 2018)
            </br>
            In this article, we will go through an example of how to migrate a python application to AWS lambda.</br>
            We will not make any code changes(or re-architect it) to our app in order to migrate it.

            <a href="blogs/2/consensus.html">Exploring consensus via python.</a>(24 Mar 2018)
            </br>
            How do you get different computers that are part of a larger cluster to agree on what the value of
            something is?</br>
            We try and answer that question.</br>
            We also learn about, CASPaxos, the consensus protocol.

            <a href="blogs/1/go-gc-maps.html">Go Garbage collector and Large maps with pointers.</a>(25 Jan 2018)
            </br>
            I'm left wondering, shouldn't the Go runtime then not do it for me/you by default?</br>
            Anytime the runtime sees a map that is larger than X and the keys to that map contains pointers,</br>
            the runtime inlines(for lack of a better term) that map into one whose keys are ints(or whatever) and does
            the string->ints
            hashing for you without you even noticing.
