In my analysis I either cut out a whole budget item or I leave it as is.  
In other words, I do not go into the details of trying to reduce certain budget allocations. 
As an example the Goverment press is allocated KES 177m for refurbishment. We could do either of three things;
(a) Leave the allocation as is.
(b) Cut the whole allocation.
(c) Reduce the allocation.
In this article I'll always chose either option (a) or (b); I never choose (c). In other words this article is about things that I would tentatively eliminate from the budget(appropriations bill) rather than things that I would reduce/amend.   

TODO: look at the various tourism regulators(tourism board, etc)

A. https://www.treasury.go.ke/budget-books-1/
B. FY-2025-26-Development-Budget-Book-Vol.-1-1011-1083.pdf

Suss govt departments:
Office of the President
0. Government Printing Services  KES 944,596,015
   Abolish the goverment printer(goverment press aka GP); https://www.governmentpress.go.ke/background and replace it with a "Kenya Gazette website".  
   The constitution defines "Gazette" as "Gazette means the Kenya Gazette published by authority of the national government, or a supplement to the Kenya Gazette"(https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution/eng@2010-09-03#chp_Seventeen__sec_260)  
   Thus a website is enough to meet that definition.      
   The replacement(Gazette website) would require a budget to build and run. But that budget won't be kes 944m. I'm not going to include that expense here, but based on my experience building & running software applications I'm convinced it would be an expense small enough not to affect the overall calculations carried out here.
   This would also require amendments to various laws that talk about manual printing in the gazette. eg the Revision of the Laws Act
   which says: "The Laws of Kenya shall be printed in the form of booklets, a separate booklet being printed for..."; https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/act/1979/9/eng@2022-12-31#sec_6 
0. General Works at the Office of the Deputy President KES 100,000,000 
   The president's state house has a budget of KES 680m for maintenance works. The two offices can agree on how to share up that figure.
0. General Maintenance Works at Eldoret State Lodge KES 60,150,000
   General Maintenance Works at State House Sagana  KES 15,000,000
   Refurbishment of buildings at Mombasa State House KES 42,500,000
   Refurbishment of buildings at Nakuru State House KES 25,000,000
   Rehabilitation Works at Kisumu State Lodge KES 24,050,000 
   Rehabilitation Works at Kakamega State Lodge KES 25,000,000
   Kisii State Lodge KES 12,500,000 
   Nairobi state house; Purchase of Household Furniture and Institutional Equipment KES 31,000,000
   Nairobi state house; ICT: Purchase of Specialised Plant, Equipment and Machinery KES 200,000,000
   For Nairobi state house we leave intact the KES 449m for refurbishment of buildings.
   recurrent expenditure:
     State House - Mombasa KES 24,939,895
     State House - Nakuru  KES 32,336,861
     State Lodges          KES 103,123,103
   Maintain only one presidential official residence.
   Many countries have only one; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_residence  
0. Public Entities Oversight Services  KES 276,591,062
   evaluate 340 state corporations, induct 100% of board members, carry out 12 management audit reports. 
   This office seems to duplicate the `State Department for Investments and Assets Management`. That department "is entrusted with the administration of public enterprises and review of performance and providing recommendations for asset optimizatio"
   That department has a budget of 116m

1. State Department for National Government Coordination KES 194,266,125
   Mission: Effectively coordinate the formulation and implementation of National Government policies and legislations to accelerate the achievement of the National Development. 
   This is a recent creation to pad the un-constitutional Office of the Prime Cabinet Secretary. It needs to be purged using a constitutional sword.     
   Besides, this department seems to be performing duplicate work of that of the `state Department for Performance and Delivery Management` which has a `Cordination and Supervison of Government` programme. 
1.1 Office of the Prime Cabinet Secretary KES 866,803,092
    It's an un-constitutional office.
15. State Department for Parliamentary Affairs KES 333,508,889
    Created by executive order 1 of 2023.
    Mission: To proficiently oversee the development and execution of National Government policies and legislation aimed at expediting the realization of the national development agenda. 
    This is another one of those from the un-constitutional office of Prime Cabinet Secretary.
2. State Department for Devolution KES 17,226,352,790
   Mission: To offer strategic leadership and establish policy direction in the governance of devolution and intergovernmental relations.
   The State Department for Devolution is tasked with the coordination of intergovernmental relations between the National and County Governments.   
   There's significant overlap between this and the work of; the Senate, Commission on Revenue Allocation, Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council, the Council of Governors among others.    
   We already have doctors working in counties among other devolved functionationaries. What we do not have is the devolution of funds to follow those functions. It can be argued that the fact we have a national goverment 'eating' KES 17b per year ostensibly to facilitate devolution is one reason why devolution is yet to be fully achieved. 
   There also exists the `State Department for Justice Human Rights and Constitutional Affairs` which among other objects helps in Effective Implementation of the Constitution(https://www.statelaw.go.ke/departments/department-of-justice/)
3. State Department for Special Programmes KES 609,495,880
   Mission: To promote comprehensive disaster preparedness and awareness, to help vulnerable communities adapt to future challenges and mitigate impact of disasters.
   We already have national drought management authority(https://ndma.go.ke/), National Disaster Management Unit(https://disastermanagement.go.ke/) and National Disaster Operations Center(https://www.ndoc.go.ke/). I'm almost pretty certain that there's one or two others that I'm missing. How many agencies do you really need to fight disasters?  
   Additionally, almost every county has a disaster management fund(https://new.kenyalaw.org/search/?q=DISASTER+MANAGEMENT+FUND#gsc.tab=0). For example the one for Kwale county says "The County Government shall establish the County Disaster County Disaster Management Fund that shall be equivalent to 2% of annual county budget."(https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke-002/act/2016/7/eng@2016-11-04)
4. State Department for the ASALs and Regional Development KES 10,880,825,658
   Mission: To facilitate the strategic planning and development of the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) and basin-based regions, with the aim of enhancing resilience and improving livelihoods to foster socio-economic development.   
   There alrady exists the Equalisation Fund(https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution/eng@2010-09-03#chp_TWELVE__part_I__sec_204) in the constitituon and it exits  "to provide basic services ... to marginalised areas ... to bring ... those areas to the level generally enjoyed by the rest of the nation"   
   The Equalisation Fund which is allocated 0.5% of goverment revenues would not be impacted by this change.
7. State Department for Culture, The Arts and Heritage - Done.
    Culture/ Heritage         KES 1,954,224,282
    The Arts                  KES 379,286,071
    General Administration, Planning and Support Services KES 136,302,915
    I'd keep `Public Records Mangement` & `Library Services` - TODO: reconsider this, we may need to also cut this ones out. 
8. State Department for Youth Affairs and Creative Economy KES 4,305,744,453
   Mission: To improve the employability of youth, foster entrepreneurship, and stimulate job creation.
   The mandate of the State Department for Youth Affairs and Creative Economy encompasses the integration of youth into national development initiatives while effectively managing and promoting their active participation.    
   train 65 youth in film, graduate 27 people from kenya film school, etc
   This also kills the Youth Enterprise Development Fund. This is okay since the hustler fund is retained.
   I personally don't think the goverment should be engaged in this activities. For example the appropriation bill says that this department will train 61,263 youths in "mindset education" in 2025/26. I don't know what `mindset education` is, I'm guessing it's useful but it just sounds like the title to an Andrew Tate(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate) youtube video. I don't want to water down the departments achievements, for example in 2024/25 they claim to have "generated 187,451 employment opportunities for youth" which is not a bad thing. I was going to ask whether an "employment opportunity" is the same thing as a "job" but I'll stop.
9. State Department for Investment Promotion KES 3,512,463,200
   Mission: To coordinate, promote, enable, and facilitate local, diaspora, and foreign private investments by creating a competitive investment climate and business environment that fosters a sustainably transformed economy in alignment with Vision 2030.   
   It works on, among other things, establishment of EPZ's. We need to make the whole of Kenya friendly for business and not just a few selected zones where international players can get preferential treatment. We would keep the current number of gazetted EPZ's as is and willing companies can setup in there. But we wouldn't keep this state department around.
10. State Department for Gender and Affirmative Action KES 6,299,100,453
    `National Gender and Equality Commission`(https://www.ngeckenya.org/about/15/mandate) already exists. The mandate between the state department and the commission overlaps somehow.
11. State Department for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises  KES 5,593,490,075
    Created with executive order 1 of 2023. 
    Mission: To establish a cohesive and supportive framework for a highly productive and diversified Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector through strategic financing, incubation, and comprehensive entrepreneurship management and training aimed at fostering wealth generation and employment opportunities.    
    Among its highlights from 2024/25 was; 
    - Creation of 61 Constituency Industrial Development Centres
    - creation of 20,000 jobs through the Kenya Youth Enterprise (KYEOP) project
    - provision of KSh. 12.8 billion in credit through the Hustler Fund
    In 2025/26 it plans to;
    - Establish a National credit rating service. aka a 
    This effectively means that we wouldn't provide `hustler fund` with new monies. However `hustler fund` would still continue as a revolving fund using the capitation it had already received in the last ~3years. 
    So far it has had about KES 30 billion allocated to it over that period and a good part of it should still be circulating inside it. 
12. State Department for East African Community KES 784,727,960
    It's role can be performed by the ministry of foreign affairs. Neither Tanzania nor Rwanda have a specific ministry for EAC and they aren't less for it. 
13.  Ministry of East African Community (EAC), the ASALs and Regional Development - DONE
     depts:
       - East African Community          - DONE
       - ASALs and Regional Development  - DONE
14.  Ministry of Gender, Culture, the Arts, and Heritage - DONE
     depts:
       - Gender and Affirmative Action  - DONE
       - Culture, Arts and Heritage      - DONE
16. State Department for Cabinet Affairs KES 203,723,204
    Created by executive order 1 of 2023.
    Mission: To ensure the effective execution of cabinet decisions, strategic governmental initiatives, and public sector reforms, through proficient coordination aimed at fostering transformative and inclusive growth
    It facilitates cabinet meetings and oversees implementation of cabinet decisions(https://cabinetaffairs.go.ke/functions). The cabinet already has a secretary and all cabinet members have dozens of staff to do this.  
19. State Department for Trade
    Created by executive order 1 of 2023.
    Sub-programme: Export Trade Development, Promotion and National Branding KES 620,817,000
      Facilitate 10 firms to export for the first time, participate in trade promotions, brand 800 products with `made in kenya` mark of identity, do 2 global marketing campaigns.    
      As an example, any Kenyan product should be able to download and affix the `made in kenya` mark of identity without needing any ministry facilitation.
    Sub-programme: Enabling Environment for Business Growth KES 68,692,871
      create a `kenya trade development bill`, revise national trade policy, "capacity build 100 county employees on trade matters"
    Sub-programme: Development and Promotion of BETA Priorities Value Chains KES 88,418,331
      create ecommerce policy, conduct 8 training sessions for exporters of fresh produce, develop a digital services export strategy.
    Kenya National Trading Corporation (KNTC) KES 1,576,590,000 
     The actual cost saving is KES 0 because according to the budget documents, the corporation has an expenditure of kes 1.5b and an equal amount in appropriations-in-aid. 
     Mission: To ensure that KNTC plays its rightful role as a Strategic National Asset that secures price stabilization of essential food items and consumer goods(https://kntc.go.ke/)
     procure 7800 tonnes of maize, distribute 7400 tonnes of maize.    
     KNTC has not done well in its mission of stabilizing prices and I also think doing so is a futile process. The one thing it has done well though is losing money through corrupt ways like the recent KES 6billion oil scandal(https://www.citizen.digital/news/oil-scandal-kntc-hard-pressed-to-explain-losing-ksh6-billion-taxpayers-money-n350965) 
20. State Department for Industry
    Sub-programme: Industrial Development Promotion KES 5,594,154,233 
    hold 2 inter-govt consultative forums, establish 12 policy reforms, created 12 SME profiles, create 500 jobs under integrated agro industrial parks, establish/operationalize 18 County Aggregated Industrial Parks
21. State Department for Tourism
    sub-programme: Destination Marketing(kenya tourism board) KES 402,888,000 
      It's mandate is to develop, implement and co-ordinate a National Tourism marketing strategy(https://ktb.go.ke/).       
      I think this is a service that kenya can, subjectively, do without. Individual sector players(hotels, resorts, etc) can market their services globally on their own. These players can also self-organize and do promotions jointly if they so wish.
    sub-programme: Tourism Promotion (1,090,848,000 - 390,000,000) == KES 700,848,000
      remove key outputs(KO) `Tourism Research Services` & `Tourism Promotion Services` but retain `Tourism Regulatory Services`
      `Tourism Regulatory Services`(Tourism Regulatory Authority) has a budget of 390,000,000. That one we'll leave it as is.  
       KO: Tourism Research Services; conduct 3 tourism research studies, write 2 reports on tourism perfomance. 
       KO: Tourism Promotion Services; conduct 3 training forums, 25% completion of bamburi plot perimeter wall, develop 300 tourism promotion materials.
22. State Department for Science, Innovation and Research KES 942,865,404
    The State Department was not operational during the review period of Fiscal Year 2021/22 to 2023/24.
23. State Department for Diaspora Affairs
    sub-programme: Diaspora Investments, Remittances and International Jobs KES 47,101,469
      hold 2 investment expos, conduct 4 diaspora job fairs.
24. State Department for Housing & Urban Development
    sub-programme: Delivery of Affordable and Social Housing Units KES 96,000,200,000
      90% occupancy of completed units, register 580k potential homeowners on bomayangu, 100% completion of ruiru AHP, 30% completion of starehe AHP.
      The kes 96b is AIA from AHP levy. This would effectively mean repealing the AHP ACT.
25. State Department for Public Works
    sub-programme: Stalled and new Government buildings
      Delivery unit: Construction of County Headquarters-BETA KES 454,000,000
        Why is the national goverment building headquarters for counties? Counties that feel like they want a HQ can pass a motion in their own county assemblies, put it in their own budgets and finance it on their own. 
    sub-programme: Research Services
      Delivery unit: Kenya Building Research Centre KES 18,362,481
      It promotes research in building and has been vital in Affordable housing program(https://kbrc.publicworks.go.ke/).      
      This is duplicating roles that are best perfomed by universities(which are already underfunded). Since we are also killing AHP, this can die as well.
26. State Department for Information Communication Technology & Digital Economy
    sub-programme: ICT and BPO Development; this one is kes 4b. It is the one that has 
      100% operationalize konza technopolis devpt authority(KOTDA), 100% completion of konza horizontal infrastructure, 
      I wanted to kill it since I really do not believe in govt planned cities like konza. But I've left it in because; it is only 4b and more importantly it is going to get konza horizontal infrastructure to 100%.
      After that(ie, after financial year 2025/26) I believe that we should stop any further infrastructure funding of konza. It should sink or swim. 
    sub-programme: ICT Infrastructure Connectivity
      Delivery unit: Kenya Digital Economy Acceleration Project KES 3,688,002,050
      That delivery unit and `E-Government Services.Digital Superhighway` have the exact same key perfomance indicators;
      1500 internet connectivity to ward level, schols and govt, install 6170 public wifi in counties.
      Since those two are essentially doing the same thing I have eliminated one.
27. State Department for Broadcasting & Telecommunications
    sub-programme: News And Information services KES 4,727,157,566
      create 302 news briefs, produce 4200 tv news items, produce 12 monitoring reports on govt websites.
      I don't think that the government being in the business of news dissemination is particulary important. If the govt does anything worthwhile, the general masss media(plus social media) will have no trouble disseminating it.
    sub-programme: Brand Kenya Initiative KES 170,000,000
      produce kenya yearbook. What even is this??
    KBC
      Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) - recurrent expenditure KES 2,284,811,000
      KBC Analogue to Digital TV Migration-BETA                    KES 101,569,509
      KBC Rollout of Studio Mashinani-BETA                         KES 38,640,574
      I don't think that the government being in the business of news dissemination is particulary important. If the govt does anything worthwhile, the general masss media(plus social media) will have no trouble disseminating it.
28. State Department for Internal Security & National Administration
    sub-programme: Peace Building, National Cohesion and Values KES 511,182,000
      train 500 people on national cohesion, sensitize 200k people on climate change related conflicts, ensure 47 counties have county peace forums.
      I'm not discounting the need to sensitize people on how climate change can cause conflicts, I'm just saying that given our meagre resources this is something that we can put on the back burner.
    sub-programme: National Government Administration Coordination Services KES 19,681,360,942
      100% security coordination at the counties, construct 15 offices for county adminstration, refurbishment of 10 county commissioners offices.
      We need to dismantle the provincial adminstration(which nowadays they call National Government Administration). Yes chiefs do play some role but most of their roles are duplicative and are just a carry-over from the pre-2010 constitituon.    
      Chiefs do solve some family cases but this can very well be solved via the judiciary, religious roots or even via community members. Yes sometimes when you apply for your national ID it is delivered to your sub-chief, but you can as well have it delivered at the nearest huduma center. 
      Back in my village, we sometimes report chicken thieves to the chief but this a role that the police system can handle well. For every role that the provincial adminstration plays, there's a duplicate goverment office that is mandated by law to do the same. Let's let the offices mandated by law to do their work. 
      "Within five years ...national government shall restructure ...the provincial administration to accord with and respect the system of devolved government" - https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution/eng@2010-09-03#att_6__part_4__para_17
      Look at how thin the NATIONAL GOVERNMENT CO-ORDINATION ACT is; https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/act/2013/1/eng@2024-05-17
      It does not even assign any duties to national government administrative officers(chiefs, county commissioner, etc)
29. Ministry of Defence
    sub-programme: Kenya Meat Commission KES 200,000,000
                                         KES 2,980,000,000
      The 200m is expenditure and the 2.9b is recurrent. The 2.9b comes from aia(kmc's own fees) but 200m is from govt. We include the 2.9b here because the final expenditures in the budget books are inclusive of AIA.
      The defence ministry ought to have better things to do other than runnung slaughter houses. 
30. State Department for Economic Planning
    sub-programme: Community Development
      delivery unit: National Government Constituency Fund(NGCDF) KES 58,797,728,147
      CDF is un-constitutional and there are court cases from here all the way to the supreme court.               
      The only hindrance to killing this thing are members of parliament.
31. State Department for Roads KES 79,450,254,469
    The total allocation is kes 195b, with kes 115b coming from road maintenance levy and 79b from other sources.      
    We cut out the funding from other sources and are leave that department to run with the money from road maintenance levy. 
    TODO: give a maths explanation of how the monies from road development levy are enough to construct new roads and maintain existing ones.
    sub-programme: Construction of Roads and Bridges
      Looking at `Program-Based-Budget-Book` the department proposes to construct about 434 km of roads.
    sub-programme: Rehabilitation of Roads
      Looking at `Program-Based-Budget-Book` the department proposes to rehabilitate about 1453km of roads.
      Looking at `Program-Based-Budget-Book` the department proposes to gravel about 1482km of roads.
32. State Department for Transport
    Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (NAMATA) KES 465,588,000
      NAMATA(https://namata.go.ke/about_us) was established by Executive Order 18 of 2017. It's mandate with the mandate of overseeing the establishment of a public transport system within the Nairobi metro area.  
      The constitituon says that county goverments are responsible for "county transport including county roads and public road transport" (https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution/eng@2010-09-03#att_4__part_2__para_5) 
      NAMATA is therefore duplicating roles that are designated to the counties.
    Nairobi Bus Rapid Transport
      Establishment of Bus Rapid Transit Line 5 Project-Nairobi-BETA KES 441,284,613
      Nairobi Bus Rapid Transport Project-BETA KES 331,204,920
      Public Transport Technical BRT Assistance Project- Phase 1 KES 30,040,164
      The BRT project does not make sense. I'm surprised this thing is still been pursued.
33. State Department for Energy
    sub-programme: Alternative Energy Technologies KES 2,296,936,839
    install 20 stand-alone solar home systems, disseminate 75k clean cook stoves, refforest 1m hectare of hydro dams catchment areas, support 1 community small hydro project, construct 4 institutional biogas plants & 300 domestic ones.   
34. `Aids Control Unit`
    All the following offices/departments have a delivery-unit(programme/whatever) called `Aids Control Unit`. 
    As an example, the `State Department for Livestock Development` has a delivery unit called `Aids Control Unit` whose key perfomance indicators for 2025/2026 are listed as;
    Conduct 8 AIDS awareness sessions, test 200 people for AIDS. That's it. Thats their whole KPI.     
    We have a whole ministry of health and also a state corporation(The National Syndemic Diseases Control Council) that are mandated to deal with HIV/AIDS so why does every office in govt need to duplicate that?   
    What then, should every goverment office also have a `Covid control unit`?

35. State Department for Livestock Development
    Kenya leather Development Council KES 222,608,340
    It's a state corporation formed under private-public partnership to represent the interests of the leather sector(https://leathercouncil.go.ke/background-strategic-plan/)
    Representation is drawn from Livestock Marketing Council, Slaughter Houses Association, footwear manufacturers, leather manufacturers, academia, etc.   
    I think it should be possible to "represent interests of the leather sector" without using taxpayers money. Otherwise all other sectors in the industry will want to form their own tax funded councils.

update: 
- In `Program-Based-Budget-Book.pdf` we have gone upto; DONE


TODO:
- Talk about reducing goverment spening by 6% of gdp.
- Talk about reducing govt debt cost by ~30%.      
  This will involve creating a voluntary debt exchange program. Kenya debt cost for 2025/26 is kes 1.9t. This includes about kes 800b in domestic debt redemptions and 400b of domestic debt interest payments. The rest are external.     
  The exchange would involve;  
  (a) any domestic debt due this year or in the next 5 years can be exchanged into another long term govt bond.
  (b) the new bond will have an interest rate that is 100bps(1%) higher than the one its replacing.
  (c) the investor will be allowed to get a 3% upfront principal payment.
  (d) the higher interest and upfront payments are incentives to make the investors exchange their bonds.      
  todo: figure out how much in cost savings this would get us. Remember it will result in higher costs in the future(because we are just kicking the can down the road)

There are about 5 books/pdfs per year:
1. Program-Based-Budget-Book
2. Development-Budget-Book-Vol-1 
3. Development-Budget-Book-Vol-2 
4. Development-Budget-Book-Vol-3 
5. Recurrent-Budget-Book-Vol-1 
6. Recurrent-BudgetBook-Vol-2

- In each book you want to search for `Total Voted Expenditure`.    
- The values for `Total Voted Expenditure` in each `Development budget book` are going to be equal to each other, ie; it contains the total for all the devpt buget books instead of each book recording a total of just its book.     
- The values for `Total Voted Expenditure` in each `Recurrent budget book` are going to be equal to each other, ie; it contains the total for all the recurrent buget books instead of each book recording a total of just its book.     
- The values for `Total Voted Expenditure` in the `Program-Based-Budget-Book` contains the total of both the development and recurrent books.        
  Let's take an example from the 2025/2026 books and take `State Department for Forestry`.      
  In the `Program-Based-Budget-Book` it is listed as; KES 8,932,168,653(gross current estimates) 4,057,041,057(gross capital estimates) 12,989,209,710(gross total estimates)       
  In the `Recurrent budget book` it is listed as;     KES 8,932,168,653(gross estimates)         4,950,000,000(aia)                     3,982,168,653(net estimates)        
  In the `Development budget book` it is listed as;   KES 4,057,041,057(gross estimates)         1,276,000,000(aia)                     2,781,041,057(net estimates)          
  See; `12,989,209,710 = 8,932,168,653 + 4,057,041,057`. ie, the total in program-based-budget is equal to total from recurrent and development budgets.      
  Notice also that the gross/total amounts in both recurrent and development budget books already includes `AIA/loans/grants`. eg `4,057,041,057 == 1,276,000,000 + 2,781,041,057`     
  This also means that the total amounts in `Program-Based-Budget-Book` also include `AIA/loans/grants`.
- In the `Program-Based-Budget-Book`;           
  (a) the term `gross current estimates` means the value from the recurrent expenditure.   ie, `current == recurrent`      
  (b) the term `gross capital estimates` means the value from the development expenditure. ie, `capital == development`        
  (c) the term `Appropriations in Aid`(AIA/aia) means either grants, loans or fees collected by the agency in question.       
- In `Program-Based-Budget-Book` look for `CONSOLIDATED FUND SERVICES`;       
  (a) `GRAND TOTAL INTERNAL DEBT - INTEREST`
  (b) `Interest - Internal`
  (c) `Interest- External`
  (d) `PENSIONS, SALARIES & ALLOWANCES AND OTHERS`
- In the 2025/2026 `Program-Based-Budget-Book`, the total expenditure is KES 2,428,394,968,440 (kes 2.43trillion).
  This is the total government expenditure(both recurrent + development).       
  Note that this figure is inclusive of AIA/grants/loans.    
  This is about KES 2.43 trillion. 
- In the 2025/2026 `Program-Based-Budget-Book`, the total `consolidated fund services` had expenditure of KES 2,141,025,101,165 (kes 2.14trillion).      
  This includes; internal & external debt interests, internal & external debt redemptions, pensions, subscriptions to international organisations(like UN, etc), salaries & allowances for constitutional office holders.      
  Interest is    KES ~850b(internal), 240b(external)     
  Redemptions is KES ~460b(internal), 340b(external)
  Pensions is    KES ~230b
- To find `road maintenance levy`, search for sub programme `Maintenance of Roads` under `State Department for Roads` in `Program-Based-Budget-Book`. The key outputs are named `Transfer of receipts`.    
  For example for 2025/2026 it is listed as (115,582,269,200). This figure matches the one reported in the news of 115b; https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/where-rise-in-road-maintenance-levy-will-hurt-most-4692312



road maintenance levy:
- KES 25/liter
- KES 15 (kenha 40%, kerra 32%, kura 15%, kws 1%, krb 2%)
  the kerra 32% goes to 290 constituents
  krb 2% is for admin costs.
- KES 3 annuity fund(to help with PPPs)
- KES 7 (krb securitizes it to pay pending bills)
  There's KES 175b in pending bills. The govt hopes to raise 175b in 10yrs from the kes7.

For financial year 2023/24:
total = KES 71.6b
road annuity fund = KES 12.2b
kenha = 27.7b
kura = 9.9b
kws = 662m
kerra = 21.2b (KES 63m/constituency)

   ng-cdf commitee: 4
