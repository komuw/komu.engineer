                <strong> An early peek at Go modules.(20 July 2018)</strong>
                </br>
                </br>
                <i><strong>Update:</strong>Since the writing of this article, Go1.11 came out with experimental
                    support
                    for Go modules. Some of the commands were also renamed/removed so this blogpost is in some sense
                    outdated. However the main concepts still stand.</br></br></i>
                <strong>Intro</strong>
                </br>
                In this article, we will take go modules(earlier on it had the codename vgo) for a spin. A module is a
                collection of related
                Go packages. Modules are the unit of source code interchange and versioning.</br>
                With modules, you can now work outside of GOPATH and also version your code in such a way that go is
                aware of.</br>

                At the time of writing this, we need to be using go compiled from master branch for us to be able to
                use go modules. </br>
                So lets do that, We could clone go from master and compile it ourselves, but I won't do that; instead
                I'll use
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/travis-ci/gimme">gimme</a> which is a tool
                developed by TravisCI peeps to help in installing various go versions.
                </br>
                The instructions on how to install gimme can
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/travis-ci/gimme"> be found here</a>; But
                since I'm on OSX; </br>
            <pre><code class="bash">
brew install gimme && gimme master
                </code></pre> That installs gimme and then uses gimme to install Go from master branch.</br>
            </br>

            Lets activate the newly installed go and check version
            <pre><code class="bash">
source ~/.gimme/envs/gomaster.env && go version

go version devel +d278f09333 Thu Jul 19 05:40:37 2018 +0000 darwin/amd64
                </code></pre>

            </br>
            <strong>What up now</strong>
            </br>
            I have a go package called
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/komuw/meli">meli</a> and we are going to
            convert that to use go modules. </br>
            meli is a faster, smaller alternative to docker-compose(albeit with less features.) So lets clone meli
            in a directory that
            is outside GOPATH. </br>
            My GOPATH is at ~/go so we'll clone into ~/mystuff instead.
            <pre><code class="bash">
git clone git@github.com:komuw/meli.git ~/mystuff/meli && cd ~/mystuff/meli
                </code></pre> run;
            <pre><code class="bash">
go mod -init
  go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/komuW/meli
  go: copying requirements from Gopkg.lock
                </code></pre> the -init flag initializes and writes a new
            <i>go.mod</i> to the current directory, in effect creating a new module rooted at the current
            directory. </br>
            If you were using another dependency manager before, mod -nit will intialize the
            <i>go.mod</i> file using that dependency manager's files. I was using dep as my dependency manager so
            go mod
            -init used that. </br>
            From what I understand, go mod "already supports reading
            <strong>nine</strong> different legacy file formats (GLOCKFILE, Godeps/Godeps.json, Gopkg.lock,
            dependencies.tsv,
            glide.lock, vendor.conf, vendor.yml, vendor/manifest, vendor/vendor.json)" -
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23966#issuecomment-367428464">see
                this comment by Russ Cox.</a>
            </br>
            It's nice to see that, the Go team has put some thought into that.</br>

            Let's have a look at the
            <i>go.mod</i> file it created;
            <pre><code class="bash">
module github.com/komuw/meli

require (
	github.com/Microsoft/go-winio v0.4.8
	github.com/docker/distribution v0.0.0-20170720211245-48294d928ced
	github.com/docker/docker v1.13.1
	github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers v0.6.1
	github.com/docker/go-connections v0.3.0
	github.com/docker/go-units v0.3.3
	github.com/pkg/errors v0.8.0
	golang.org/x/net v0.0.0-20180712202826-d0887baf81f4
	golang.org/x/sys v0.0.0-20180715085529-ac767d655b30
	gopkg.in/yaml.v2 v2.2.1
)
                </code></pre> All my dependencies that were listed in
            <i>Gopkg.lock</i> have been added to
            <i>go.mod</i> with their correct versions.</br>
            Notice though that under dep, meli depended on
            <i>github.com/docker/distribution</i>
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://github.com/komuw/meli/blob/3127f1c5bdb82db7c0df6112ada8e6e953546aa4/Gopkg.lock#L12-L21">version
                v2.6.2</a>

            However go mod added it with version v0.0.0-20170720211245-48294d928ced </br>
            That is called a pseudo-version, the second part(20170720211245) is the timestamp in UTC of the commit
            hash 48294d928ced.
            The commit 48294d928ced is the commit corresponding to version v2.6.2,
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href=" https://github.com/docker/distribution/commit/48294d928ced5dd9b378f7fd7c6f5da3ff3f2c89">see
                here</a>
            </br>
            Note: the pseudo versions are expected behaviour whilst a project is not yet a module (and its versions
            is >=2)</br>
            </br>

            Pretty neat, huh; but does it work? </br>
            Let's build the damn thing and see if it works(remember we are doing all these outside of GOPATH) </br>
            <pre><code class="bash">
go build -o meli cli/cli.go && ./meli --help 
    Usage of ./meli:
    -build
        Rebuild services
    -d	Run containers in the background
    -f string
        path to docker-compose.yml file. (default "docker-compose.yml")
    -up
        Builds, re/creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.
    -v	Show version information.
    -version
        Show version information.
                </code></pre> It works fine.</br>

            <i>go.mod</i> is not the only file created, a
            <i>go.sum</i> file was also created.
            <pre><code class="bash">
cat go.sum
    github.com/Microsoft/go-winio v0.4.8/go.mod h1:VhR8bwka0BXejwEJY73c50VrPtXAaKcyvVC4A4RozmA=
    github.com/docker/distribution v0.0.0-20170720211245-48294d928ced h1:/ybq/Enozyi+nBSAkL4j7vd+IBV6brrxB2srIO5VWos=
    ....
                </code></pre>

            <i>go.sum</i> contains the expected cryptographic checksums of the content of specific module versions</br>
            The go command maintains a cache of downloaded packages(in $GOPATH/src/mod) and computes and records
            the cryptographic checksum
            of each package at download time. </br>
            The 'go mod -verify' command checks that the cached copies of module downloads still match both their
            recorded checksums
            and the entries in
            <i>go.sum</i>
            </br>

            Lets check this crypto thing.
            <pre><code class="bash">
echo "Im a hacker" >> ~/go/src/mod/github.com/pkg/errors@v0.8.0/README.md
                </code></pre> Then run;
            <pre><code class="bash">
go mod -verify
    github.com/pkg/errors v0.8.0: dir has been modified (~/go/src/mod/github.com/pkg/errors@v0.8.0)   
                </code></pre> If you work in enterprise, this is the point at which you call in your Red team to
            figure out who is messing
            up with your packages.
            </br>
            Even though, we messed with the cached github.com/pkg/errors package, it doesnt stop us from building
            our package.</br>
            <i>go build -o meli cli/cli.go</i> still works okay. I do not know if go build should complain if it
            finds the
            cached packages have been messed with, or whether it should redownload them afresh or just build the
            package
            as if nothing has happened(like it did.)</br>
            </br>
            However, if you mess with the
            <i>go.sum</i> file; go build fails with an error.
            <pre><code class="bash">
sed -i.bak "s/1NNxqwp/hackedHash/" go.sum && go build -o meli cli/cli.go
    go: verifying gopkg.in/yaml.v2@v2.2.1/go.mod: checksum mismatch
    downloaded: h1:hI93XBmqTisBFMUTm0b8Fm+jr3Dg1NNxqwp+5A1VGuI=
    go.sum:     h1:hI93XBmqTisBFMUTm0b8Fm+jr3DghackedHash+5A1VGuI=
                </code></pre> I'm liking the look of this crypto checksuming thing.</br>
            </br>

            go mod has other flags that you can try out, run
            <i>go help mod</i> to see them all. lets try the -sync flag which "synchronizes
            <i>go.mod</i> with the source code in the module."</br>
            Synchronization of modules seems like something we might want to do, right?</br>
            <pre><code class="bash">
go mod -sync
go: finding github.com/stretchr/testify/assert latest
go: finding github.com/stevvooe/resumable/sha256 latest
..
                </code></pre> wait, why is it adding new packages?</br>
            It added new packages to
            <i>go.mod</i> with a comment //indirect Let's see if the documentation can help us discover what is up
            with
            these //indirect thing.</br>
            <pre><code class="bash">
go help mod | grep -i indirect -A 2 -B 2
  Note that this only describes the go.mod file itself, not other modules
  referred to indirectly. For the full set of modules available to a build,
  use 'go list -m -json all'.
                </code></pre> not useful, lets try go help modules instead. I do not know why the documentation is
            spread between go help
            mod and go help modules; but anyway;</br>
            <pre><code class="bash">
go help modules | grep -i indirect -A 2 -B 2
... Requirements needed only for indirect uses are marked with a
"// indirect" comment in the go.mod file. Indirect requirements are
automatically removed from the go.mod file once they are implied by other
                </code></pre> Okay, so the documentation seems to be saying that, for example in meli's case; although
            meli does not use
            <i>github.com/stretchr/testify</i> one of it's dependencies may be using it.</br>
            So which dependency of meli is using testify(meli doesnt use testify or any other non-stdlib testing
            libraries)? </br>
            Because meli still vendors its dependencies, lets see if we can use grep to find out;
            <pre><code class="bash">
grep -rsIin testify .
  ./go.mod:14:	github.com/stretchr/testify v1.2.2 // indirect
  ./go.sum:21:github.com/stretchr/testify v1.2.2 h1:bSDNvY7ZPG5RlJ8otE/7V6gMiyenm9RtJ7IUVIAoJ1w=
  ./go.sum:22:github.com/stretchr/testify v1.2.2/go.mod h1:a8OnRcib4nhh0OaRAV+Yts87kKdq0PP7pXfy6kDkUVs=
                </code></pre> grep isn't helping, maybe go mod has a flag to give us this information?</br>
            go mod has a -graph flag which according to the documentation; "The -graph flag prints the module
            requirement graph (with
            replacements applied) in text form." </br>
            niice, looks like what we need.
            <pre><code class="bash">
go mod -graph
  github.com/komuw/meli github.com/stevvooe/resumable@v0.0.0-20170302213456-2aaf90b2ceea
  github.com/komuw/meli github.com/stretchr/testify@v1.2.2
  github.com/komuw/meli golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20180712202826-d0887baf81f4
                </code></pre> That's not very helpful, I still do not know which dependency introduced
            <i>github.com/stretchr/testify.</i> I asked on the
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gophers.slack.com">#modules slack channel</a> and
            someone suggested I try go list; but
            <i>go list -test -deps | grep testify</i> didn't help either.

            </br>
            </br>
            <strong>Go modules and code contribution</strong>
            </br>
            One of the hardest things I've had before with Go is contributing to other peoples' projects. </br>
            Usually -in other languages- you would fork the project, make changes, run to make sure everything
            works okay, then when
            happy, open a pull request from your fork to the other project. </br>
            With Go however, I've had problems. I would fork a project and make changes; but when it came to
            running the thing, things
            would go haywire. </br>
            This is because import paths would still be pointing to the old project instead of mine. Note; this is
            probably my own failing
            rather than that of Go. If you think I've been doing it wrong, let me know.</br>
            I recently came across this tweet by
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/francesc/status/1009487969198075905">Francesc
                Campoy</a> and it has improved things for me, but it still felt odd. </br>
            Talking of Campoy, he has a fantastic
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_BzFbxG2za3bp5NRRRXJSw">youtube
                channel</a> that is all things Go, If you have never checked out, do yourselve a favour.</br>
            </br>
            Can go modules help us here? It turns out, they can! I guess.</br>
            </br>

            meli depends on
            <i>github.com/docker/docker/client</i>. </br>
            Let's say we wanted to add some feature to the docker client that we would later propose in a pull
            request to docker. I forked
            docker over to
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/komuw/moby">https://github.com/komuw/moby</a>
            </br>
            Now lets clone our fork into a directory that is outside GOPATH
            <pre><code class="bash">
git clone git@github.com:komuw/moby.git ~/mystuff/moby
                </code></pre> The feature we want to add is; every time you declare a docker client(using
            <i>client.NewEnvClient() </i>), it should log the docker version that you are using. </br>
            Here's the change I made to the
            <i>NewEnvClient</i> function
            <pre><code class="go">
func NewEnvClient() (*Client, error) {
    +	fmt.Println("\n\t You are using docker version:", api.DefaultVersion)
        return NewClientWithOpts(FromEnv)
}
                </code></pre> The full diff
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://github.com/komuw/moby/compare/683738900eec52f86b834234eeef054c4e135031...komuw:master">can
                be seen here</a>
            </br>
            We have made changes to the docker client on our local clone at
            <i>~/mystuff/moby</i>. How do we use that change in
            <i>meli</i> before even pushing those changes to our fork(before even sending a pull request to
            docker)?</br>

            go modules supports dependency replacement. The replacement can point to go code that is
            anywhere(including in our machine.)</br>
            Add the following line to
            <i>go.mod</i>
            <pre><code class="bash">
replace github.com/docker/docker v1.13.1 => ~/mystuff/moby
                </code></pre> That is telling go to replace the docker dependency with a local dependency at the path
            ~/mystuff/moby</br>
            <pre><code class="bash">
go mod -verify
    go: errors parsing go.mod:
    ~/mystuff/meli/go.mod:20: replacement module without version must be directory path (rooted or starting with ./ or ../)
                </code></pre> nice error message, let's comply and use relative paths; change the line in
            <i>go.mod</i> to
            <pre><code class="bash">
replace github.com/docker/docker v1.13.1 => ../moby
                </code></pre>

            <pre><code class="bash">
go mod -verify
  go: parsing ../moby/go.mod: open ~/mystuff/moby/go.mod: no such file or directory
  go: error loading module requirements
                </code></pre> This time around the error message is not that descriptive. Paul Jolly(who has been

            that "the new path should be a directory on the local system that contains a module"</br>
            So lets add a go.mod file to our clone of moby(docker)
            <pre><code class="bash">
echo 'module "github.com/docker/docker"' >> ~/mystuff/moby/go.mod && \
go mod -verify
  all modules verified

            Lets rebuild meli to use our modified copy of docker.

            deeper than just
            go modules?? Maybe?</br>
            My speculation is that the way docker uses import path comments of the form</br>
            <i>package client // import "github.com/docker/docker/client"</i>
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/683738900eec52f86b834234eeef054c4e135031/client/client.go#L42">
                see here
            </a>, is muddying things.</br>
            So probably, even though I have added a replace statement</br>
            <i>github.com/docker/docker v1.13.1 => ../moby</i>
            </br>
            the code in
            <i>../moby</i> still has import comments
            <i>// import "github.com/docker/docker/client"</i>
            that makes go try and use
            <i>github.com/docker/docker</i> which is what we wanted to replace in the first place??</br>
            I'm just speculating here, there's a good probability that there's something I'm overlooking.</br>
            </br>
            I'll try and open an issue with the go repo(or ask on #modules slack channel) sometime later if just to
            satisfy my curiosty.</br>

            Even though I was not able to use a local copy of docker, I was able to carry out the same procedure
            with another package.</br>
            Lets undo the replace directive we had in
            <i>go.mod</i>
            </br>
            We are going to try and add
            <i>github.com/pkg/errors</i> as a dependency to meli, we will fork it(pkg/errors), clone it outside
            GOPATH,
            make changes to it and try to use our local copy.</br>
            here's the change I made to
            <i>meli</i> to use
            <i>github.com/pkg/errors</i> for error handling;
            <pre><code class="go">
import "github.com/pkg/errors"
func main() {
	err := errors.New("whoops useless error")
	fmt.Printf("%v", err)
  ....
}

                be seen here</a>
            </br>
            run
            <i>go mod -sync</i> so that those changes get picked up. When you do that,
            <i>github.com/pkg/errors v0.8.0</i> is added as a direct dependency.</br>
            Lets fork errors package to
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/komuw/errors">https://github.com/komuw/errors</a>
            and clone it locally to a path outside GOPATH ie
            <i>~/mystuff/errors</i>
            </br>

            Then we add a replacement directive in
            <i>meli's</i>
            <i>go.mod</i>
            <pre><code class="bash">
replace github.com/pkg/errors v0.8.0 => ../errors
                </code></pre> of course we also add a go.mod file to the local errors package
            <pre><code class="bash">
echo 'module "github.com/pkg/errors"' >> ~/mystuff/errors/go.mod
                </code></pre> As more packages/modules add
            <i>go.mod</i> files to their repo's we won't have to do this. I wish go mod would be able to
            automatically add
            a
            <i>go.mod</i> file for you, but it seems like per

                comment from Russ Cox</a> that it is not possible to do so without unwanted side effects?</br>

            Let's modify the local errors package. We want to modify the
            <i>errors.New</i> function to log something when called. The change I made is;
            <pre><code class="go">
func New(message string) error {
	fmt.Println("\n\t hello new called.")
	return &fundamental{

            Lets build meli and run it.

            <i>meli</i> is now using
            <i>github.com/pkg/errors</i> for error handling, but we are using a local copy of our fork of
            <i>github.com/pkg/errors</i>
            </br>
            Pretty neat if you ask me.

            <strong>Conclusion</strong>
            </br>
            I like the direction that go modules is taking. Not all t's are tied and i's dotted; At the time of
            writing this, there are
            about
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amodules">40
                open issues</a>
            concerning go modules. I expect that number to rise as more people try out go modules.</br>
            go modules is expected to ship with Go version 1.11(eta ~August) as an experimental feature.</br>
            go modules will also make it possible for Go to download packages from a registry of your choice(à la
            npm, pypi etc). </br>
            Have a look at

            which is an upcoming package registry and proxy server for Go

            Shout out to Paul Jolly, Jeff Wendling, Bryan C. Mills, Russ Cox among others who have had to do a lot
            of hand holding all
            over the internet on go modules related issues/questions.</br>
